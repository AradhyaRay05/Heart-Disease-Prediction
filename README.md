# HeartGuardAI - AI Powered Heart Disease Predictor

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goal  
HeartGuardAI is designed to assist in the early detection of heart disease by leveraging machine learning models.  
The goal is to provide a simple, accurate, and accessible tool for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.  
The project aims to support preventive healthcare and reduce diagnostic delays.

---

## ðŸ“– Overview  
HeartGuardAI uses a trained deep learning model to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.  
It processes key health parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, then delivers predictions through an easy-to-use **Streamlit web interface**.  
This project demonstrates the complete ML pipeline from **data preprocessing** to **deployment**.

---

### ðŸš€ Future Enhancements  
- Deploy on **cloud platforms** like Heroku or Streamlit Cloud  
- Add visualization of prediction probabilities  
- Expand dataset for improved generalization  
- Implement explainable AI techniques for better interpretability
